## Installation

Install the package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g quick-cli-notes
```

This will make the `quicknote` command available globally on your system.

## Features

- **Add notes**: Quickly add notes with an optional tag and priority level.
- **List notes**: View all your notes, filter by tag, or priority.
- **Edit notes**: Modify an existing note by its index.
- **Remove notes**: Delete a note by its index.
- **Search notes**: Search through your notes by keyword.
- **MongoDB integration**: Store your notes in a MongoDB database for persistent, scalable storage.
- **Priority and Tags**: Organize notes by setting priority levels and tags (e.g., `work`, `personal`).

## Usage

### Add a Note

Add a new note with optional tag and priority (default tag is `general` and priority is `low`):

```bash
quicknote add "This is a new note" --tag work --priority high
```

**Options:**

- `--tag`: Assign a tag to the note (default: `general`).
- `--priority`: Set the priority level (`low`, `medium`, `high`).

### List Notes

List all notes, filter by tag or priority:

```bash
quicknote list
```

**Optional Filters:**

- `--tag <tag>`: Filter notes by tag.
- `--priority <priority>`: Filter notes by priority level.

Example:

```bash
quicknote list --tag work
```

### Edit a Note

Edit a note by its index:

```bash
quicknote edit <index> "Updated note text"
```

Example:

```bash
quicknote edit 2 "Updated note with new content"
```

### Remove a Note

Remove a note by its index:

```bash
quicknote remove <index>
```

Example:

```bash
quicknote remove 3
```

### Search Notes

Search for notes that contain a specific keyword:

```bash
quicknote search <keyword>
```

Example:

```bash
quicknote search "meeting"
```

## MongoDB Integration

The package allows you to use MongoDB for storing notes. This is especially useful when you need a scalable and persistent storage solution.

### Setting Up MongoDB

1. Create a **MongoDB cluster** on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or use your local MongoDB server.
2. Get your MongoDB connection URI (something like this):

   ```
   mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/quicknotesDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

3. Add your MongoDB URI to the environment variables (explained below).

### Environment Variables

To secure your MongoDB connection, use an environment variable to store the MongoDB URI. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/quicknotesDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Make sure your `.env` file is not exposed publicly by adding it to your `.gitignore`:

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

In production, set the environment variable `MONGODB_URI` with your MongoDB URI.

## Advanced Features

1. **Tag and Priority Management**: Organize your notes with custom tags and priority levels. Example: `quicknote add "Buy groceries" --tag personal --priority high`.
2. **Timestamps**: Track when notes were created or updated (possible feature enhancement).
3. **Cloud Storage**: Use MongoDB for cloud-based storage.
4. **User Authentication**: Future plans for integrating user authentication to allow multi-user support and personal note management.
5. **Encryption**: Option to encrypt sensitive notes (future feature).
